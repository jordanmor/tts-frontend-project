### Original Project Instructions 

- Choose one of the three example sites listed below.
- Using what you've learned with HTML/CSS/JS and Bootstrap, mimic the example site you choose as closely as possible in the time alloted.
- When building your version of the site, don't worry about making it exactly the same to the pixel. Instead, focus on creating the same structure, sections, text/images, etc.
- Don't forget to utilize quick tools available to you, like Bootstrap's components. 

- URLs of example sites:  
    - thehartford.com/about-us  
    - shopify.com  
    - wordpress.com
