### My Personal Project Goals
- Recreate a functional sidebar that closely resembles the one used on The Hartford's site for smaller screens.
- Recreate a functional navbar with dropdown menus, including a full MY ACCOUNT menu, that closely resembles the one used on The Hartford's site for larger screens.
- Create the page using a mobile-first approach.
- Use responsive web design and Bootstrap to successfully layout all elements of the site according to screen size.
- Using CSS, recreate the smaller animated elements of the page that add an interactive feel to the site. 
- Find, edit and optimize SVG icons that closely resemble the icons used on The Hartford's site. Use Affinity Designer and Jake Archibald's SVGOMG for SVG editing and optimization.
- Open a modal with a YouTube video about The Hartford's Human Achievement Programs when associated link clicked on page. Use jQuery to make sure the video no longer plays in the background if the modal is closed before the video play has ended.
- Add a link and a downloadable PDF fact sheet about The Hartford as it is present on the The Hartford's About Me page
- Showcase an attention to detail with this project.

### Original Project Instructions 

- Choose one of the three example sites listed below.
- Using what you've learned with HTML/CSS/JS and Bootstrap, mimic the example site you choose as closely as possible in the time alloted.
- When building your version of the site, don't worry about making it exactly the same to the pixel. Instead, focus on creating the same structure, sections, text/images, etc.
- Don't forget to utilize quick tools available to you, like Bootstrap's components. 
- URLs of example sites:  
    - thehartford.com/about-us  
    - shopify.com  
    - wordpress.com
